The Filigree and house etchings are lovingly cared for, but the frame itself has been allowed to take on light battle damage as a badge of honour.

  description: The Wanderer class is a mainstay of the Imperial Cavalry corps as its low profile and light maintenance makes it perfectly suited for freshly graduated cadets and down-on-their-luck Ritters to support the Imperial Navy and heavier Exos. Their construction, while fragile, is speedy enough to perform reconnaissance in asteroid belts and battlefields alike, and powerful synthmuscle arms can mount a variety of infantry level equipment for harassment. Wanderers frequently fall short and are expected to be recalled or bunker down on nearby wrecks or asteroids when enemy fighter support is in a sector, as any caught in the open are doomed to be stripped apart.
